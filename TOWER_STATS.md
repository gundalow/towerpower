## Upgrade Scaling

Upgrades are chosen randomly from three categories when an upgrade is purchased. Scaling is **additive** based on the tower's base stats.

### Upgrade Cost
The cost of each upgrade increases linearly based on the tower's base price:
- **1st Upgrade:** 30% of base price
- **2nd Upgrade:** 40% of base price
- **3rd Upgrade:** 50% of base price
- (Increase by 10% or 1000 basis points for each subsequent upgrade)

### 1. Damage & Range
- **Damage (Standard):** +20% of base damage + 1 per level.
- **Damage (Chicken Rice):** +30% of base damage + 2 per level.
- **Range:** +0.5 hexes per level.

### 2. Fire Rate
